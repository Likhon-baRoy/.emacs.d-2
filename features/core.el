containing it, until no links are left at any level.")

Use this as permanent storage for files that are safe to share across
systems (if this config is symlinked across several computers).")

Use this for files that don't change much, like servers binaries,
external dependencies or long-term shared data.")

Use this for files that change often, like cache files.")

(defvar user-host-dir (concat user-etc-dir "hosts/" (system-name))
  "The directory with user-specific Emacs settings.
Function `system-name' returns the host name of the machine you
are running on, as a string.")
