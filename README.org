#+TITLE: My Emacs Configuration

This repository contains my personal Emacsâ€™ configuration,
notes and any other resources for the Emacs which I port around from system
to system with me.

The configuration depends on Org mode and only supports Emacs >= 25.1.
[[file:init.el][init.el]] sets up a few initial GUI settings, bootstraps [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]],
[[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package][quelpa-use-package]] and loads [[file:settings.org][settings.org]],
which is where the majority of the configuration magic happens.
